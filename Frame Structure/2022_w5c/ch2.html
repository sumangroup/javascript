    Scheduling of processes/work is done to finish the work on time. CPU Scheduling is a process that allows one process
    to use the CPU while another process is delayed (in standby) due to unavailability of any resources such as I / O
    etc, thus making full use of the CPU. The purpose of CPU Scheduling is to make the system more efficient, faster,
    and fairer
