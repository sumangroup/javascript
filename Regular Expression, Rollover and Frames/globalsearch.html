        Is An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program,
        manages all of the other application programs in a computer. The application programs make use of the operating
        system by making requests for services through a defined application program interface (API). In addition, users
        can interact directly with the operating system through a user interface, such as a command-line interface (CLI)
        or a graphical UI (GUI).
